      <h2 class="favorites-h2">Introduction:</h2>
        <p>Target audience is for those that already have some interest in skateboarding, that could use some information on the now defunct company. The 'Home' section shows a photo of the Cliche team, the 'Videos' section displays few of the many videos that were released prior to the company's closure, and the 'Favorites' section is a list of my personal videos created by the team.   </p>
      <h2 class="favorites-h2">Design:</h2>
        <p>The website were kept to four sections, all of which can be navigated with the menu bar below the header. The site uses a yellow and black color scheme for the mid and the fore-ground, and  a light-blue fade in the back. Yellow was chosen because it was the color most often used for company graphics and advertisements. I also made sure to keep a level of consistency with the design between the sections, by maintaining the color scheme and only using two fonts (Monaco and Verdana). Language is indicated with the "lang" attribute in the html tag to assist screen readers, and "alt" attributes were added to img tags for text replacement.</p>
